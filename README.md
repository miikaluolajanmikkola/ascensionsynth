ascensionsynth
==============

Matrix wavetable synth, playable with computer keyboard. Generates 81 discreet tones for frequencies tempered by a three-dimensional matrix. Contains all ancient solfeggios, A4=432Hz etc. UI implements a beautiful, "ascending" visual representation of the concept: colors are mixed with the numbers in the grid. Performance issues prevent virtuous expression, each audible tone is a generated 1s/96kHz raw waveform, and that is going to change when I learn about meaningful DSP algorithms.
